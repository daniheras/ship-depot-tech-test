# ShipDepot (Tech Test)

This project serves as a tech test.

## Project Structure

The project uses the NextJS app router. The project is divided into domains. Each domain has its own folder in the `app` directory.

The `_shared` directory contains shared components, hooks, and utilities shared across the domains. Thats the case for the `ui library` as well.
